    <h1>Law Firm Website Revision and Reflection</h1>
    <p>Learning Experiences working on project and experience during the semester</p>
    <p>Things I did well</p>
    <p>What would I have done differently?</p>
    <h4>Feedback received and what I did to address those issues those recomended changes.</h4> 
    <p>I asked my wife to provide feedback on the website. Here was her feedback:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She did not like the color scheme.</li>
      <li>She did not like the tagline next to the "Townsend Firm" header.</li>
      <li>She wanted the content in the nav list to be the same color as the headers.</li>
      <li>She wanted the background color of the navigation element to be lighter. She had trouble reading it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In response to her feedback, I changed the color scheme. I also removed the tagline next to the "Townsend Firm" header. I changed the color of the content in the nav list to be the same color as the headers. Lastly, I changed the background color of the navigation element to be lighter.</p>

    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a web design strategy that seems more utilitarian than the previous gradual degradation strategy. It sets delivery of content to the most people as the main priority in web design. On the other hand, gradual degradation, appears to have put priority on delivering content and functionality only to the latest browsers. If an end user was visiting the site using an old browser or old machine, the gradual degradation approach may hinder that user's accessibility.</p>
    <p>With the proliferation of the internet, reaching the farthest and remotest corners of the world, if the designer's goal is to reach the broadest possible audience, then progressive enhancement is the best approach. I'm not sure if the creators of this approach knew at the time that in the future everyone would have a smart phone, but this fact I think lends further support to progressive enhancement being the best web design strategy.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I only recently learned that there are many different browsers out there that could be used. And in my opinion, I think it's likely that in the future, users will have even more options with respect to the use of browsers. The internet may become more regionalized globally, with countries preferring to use local web companies over multinationals. This lends further credence to web design being implemented with the expectation that content may be accessed from a wide variety of browsers and machines.</p>
