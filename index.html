    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a web design strategy that seems more utilitarian than the previous gradual degradation strategy. It sets delivery of content to the most people as the main priority in web design. On the other hand, gradual degradation, appears to have put priority on delivering content and functionality only to the latest browsers. If an end user was visiting the site using an old browser or old machine, the gradual degradation approach may hinder that user's accessibility.</p>
    <p>With the proliferation of the internet, reaching the farthest and remotest corners of the world, if the designer's goal is to reach the broadest possible audience, then progressive enhancement is the best approach. I'm not sure if the creators of this approach knew at the time that in the future everyone would have a smart phone, but this fact I think lends further support to progressive enhancement being the best web design strategy.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I only recently learned that there are many different browsers out there that could be used. And in my opinion, I think it's likely that in the future, users will have even more options with respect to the use of browsers. The internet may become more regionalized globally, with countries preferring to use local web companies over multinationals. This lends further credence to web design being implemented with the expectation that content may be accessed from a wide variety of browsers and machines.</p>

    <h1>Law Firm Website Revision and Reflection</h1>
    <h4>Learning Experiences working on project and experience during the semester</h4>
    <p>I enjoyed working on this project and only wish I had more time to devote to making the perfect website. When I first started out, I think I got ahead of myself without writing out an outline and plan. But I eventually just wrote up a bare bones sketch of the skeleton of the website and that helped a lot. I also tried to keep it simple and use flexbox as much as possible. This helped a lot.
    <p>The project made me realize that there is so much more that I need to learn in order to be a competent web developer. This class is sort of a side project as I am a postbacceuralate student with a full time job. That being said, I enjoyed it immensely. I really enjoyed just seeing how web pages come together and how it takes a creative person to really put together a great website. Now, if I go to a website with a unique look, I'm likely going to have to inspect the source code going forward.</p>
    <p>Overall, I hope to use the skills I learned in this class to one day develop a law firm website that is more than a static page and has more functionality.</p>
    <h4>Things I did well</h4>
    <p>I watched all of the classes and read all of the material. I reviewed materials outside of what was on the syllabus and studied the concepts. Lastly, and similar to the practice of law, I tried to manage my time as well as I could. This means knowing that the final product will not always be perfect, but that submitting it on time is the most important thing. Thus, I tried to keep the website simple and not overcomplicate it. I think I did a good job of that.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>What would I have done differently?</h4>
    <p>I think I would have studied and practiced HTML, CSS, and Javascript more before class started. I've previously studied these languages before but had forgotten most of it prior to class.</p>
    <h4>Feedback received and what I did to address those issues those recomended changes.</h4> 
    <p>I asked my wife to provide feedback on the website. Here was her feedback:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She did not like the color scheme.</li>
      <li>She did not like the tagline next to the "Townsend Firm" header.</li>
      <li>She wanted the content in the nav list to be the same color as the headers.</li>
      <li>She wanted the background color of the navigation element to be lighter. She had trouble reading it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In response to her feedback, I changed the color scheme. I also removed the tagline next to the "Townsend Firm" header. I also removed the "A view from above" part, made it white, and placed it direclty underneath the firm name.</p>
    <p>I changed the color of the content in the nav list to be the same color as the headers. Lastly, I did not change the background color of the navigation element because after changing the font color, the wife said it was more readable.</p>
